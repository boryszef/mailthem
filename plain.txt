We are pleased to inform you that the eighth edition of the international
conference Modeling and Design of Molecular Materials (MDMM 2018) will be
held in Polanica-Zdr√≥j (Poland) from June 24-th till June 28-th, 2018.

MDMM is a biannual conference devoted to presenting contemporary
computational methods along with their applications in molecular modeling
and molecular material design and related fields. Participation of
experimentalists interested in application molecular modeling techniques is
encouraged. Planned sessions include:

  * advances in computational methods
  * modeling enzyme reactions
  * rational drug and biocatalyst design
  * modeling biomolecules
  * modeling interactions in molecular materials
  * applications of bioinformatics in the design of molecular materials
  * modeling materials for nanotechnology and molecular electronics

Refereed conference proceedings will be published in the Journal of
Molecular Modeling (Springer) as it was the case with all previous MDMM
meetings.

Early bird registration and payment deadline: March 15-th, 2018; abstract
submission deadline - May 15-th, 2018.

More details about VIII-th MDMM and previous meetings are posted at the
conference website (http://mdmm.pl/2018) and in the circular of the
conference:

We would be grateful if you could disseminate the information among your
colleagues.

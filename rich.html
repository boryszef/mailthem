We are pleased to inform you that the eighth edition of the international
conference Modeling and Design of Molecular Materials (MDMM 2018) will be held
in Polanica-Zdr√≥j (Poland) from June 24<sup>th</sup> till June 28<sup>th</sup>,
2018.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="logo.jpg" alt="MDMM2018 logo"/></p>

<p align="justify">MDMM is a biannual conference devoted to presenting
contemporary computational methods along with their applications in molecular
modeling and molecular material design and related fields. Participation of
experimentalists interested in application molecular modeling techniques is
encouraged. Planned sessions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advances in computational methods</li>
  <li>modeling enzyme reactions</li>
  <li>rational drug and biocatalyst design</li>
  <li>modeling biomolecules</li>
  <li>modeling interactions in molecular materials</li>
  <li>applications of bioinformatics in the design of molecular materials</li>
  <li>modeling materials for nanotechnology and molecular electronics</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Refereed conference proceedings will be published in
the <a href="http://link.springer.com/journal/894">Journal of Molecular
Modeling</a> (Springer) as it was the case with all previous MDMM
meetings.</p>

<p align="justify">Early bird registration and payment deadline:
March 15<sup>th</sup>, 2018; abstract submission deadline - May
15<sup>th</sup>, 2018.</p>

<p align="justify">More details about VIII<sup>th</sup> MDMM and previous
meetings are posted at the <a href="http://mdmm.pl/2018">conference website</a>
and in the <a href="https://mdmm.pl/2018/doc/afisz/afisz2018.pdf">circular of
the conference</a>. We would be grateful if you could disseminate the
information among your colleagues.</p>
